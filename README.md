Instagram-style app with a database (Firebase). I did this as a practice so as not to forget my knowledge in Reac.js, since I currently work with Vue.js. Also, update my knowledge using a bit of Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
